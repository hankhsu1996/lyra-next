# LRM Gaps

Known gaps between LRM requirements and current engine capabilities. This is the work queue for LRM signoff. See `docs/lrm-signoff.md` for methodology.

When you discover a gap during `/lrm-add`, add an entry here. When you fix the gap and add the passing test, remove the entry. Both changes land in the same PR.
